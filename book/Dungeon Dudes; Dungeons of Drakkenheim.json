My personal quest is to see for myself what lies at the heart of the crater. I must overcome whatever I find there in order to stop these nightmares.",
												"{@b Arcane Secrets.} Forbidden lore lies in Drakkenheim. Several dark wizards living in the ruins have mastered terrible and powerful new magic. The Inscrutable Tower library stands unguarded, filled with spellbooks containing secret arcana. My personal quest is to learn these spells.",
												"{@b Blighted Landscape.} A blight on the natural order envelops Drakkenheim, but the contamination could spread beyond the city. My personal quest is to study the unnatural phenomena found within the most corrupt places in the city: Queen's Park Garden, the underground waterways, and the Crater's Edge. Perhaps then I can develop a way to reverse the contamination.",
												"{@b Claim the Throne.} Though my family has fallen on hard times, we were distantly related to the royal House von Kessel. I may have a claim to the throne of Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to search the cathedral, noble estates, and the castle for sufficient evidence to conclusively prove my inheritance. Then I will take the crown for myself.",

My personal quest is to join the faction, aid their mission, climb the ranks, and rise to a high leadership position within their organization.",

Alternatively,they've been taken prisoner by the faction due to some trespass or misunderstanding. Either way, my personal quest is to bring them back home.",
												"{@b Find a Cure.} I have a friend, family member, or loved one who was contaminated by delerium and turned into a monster. They have gone mad, and are lost somewhere in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to locate them, then discover a way to reverse their horrific transformation.",
												"{@b Lost Heirloom.} I used to live in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to recover a lost heirloom from my old home, which was located somewhere in the Inner City. Perhaps the item is sentimental, valuable only to members of my family. Alternatively it may have magical properties, and I wish to use these powers to aid my own ambitions.",
												"{@b Monster Slayer.} I wish to leave behind a heroic legacy by defeating dread beasts. My personal quest is to slay three of the greatest monsters rumoured to dwell in Drakkenheim, and bring back their heads as trophies. Each must be a notable creature with a challenge rating greater than my own level when I defeat them. My allies can assist me, but I must strike the decisive blow myself!",
												"{@b Overwhelming Debt.} I owe a tremendous debt of 10,000 gold pieces, maybe more. My personal quest is to pay it back by making a fortune in Drakkenheim collecting delerium, plunder, and completing work-for-hire. Meanwhile, I must hide from bounty hunters my creditor send to kill me.",
												"{@b Personal Pilgrimage.} As an acolyte of the faith, my personal quest is to visit several holy places in the city and perform a sacred ritual before the remains of the martyrs interred within each: the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, Saint Selina's Monastery, and the Chapel in Castle Drakken. Through these devoted acts I will understand my place in the divine order.",
												"{@b Score to Settle.} I have come to Drakkenheim to kill one of the faction leaders: either Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver, Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal, Lord Commander Elias Drexel, Lucretia Mathias, or the Queen of Thieves. Perhaps I seek revenge for a past wrong. Alternatively, I may covet their position and wish to replace them. Either way, my personal quest is to slay them."

They might even discover how the {@book Haze|DD|4|The Haze} threatens to engulf the world itself.",
								"The factions are deeply divided over what must be done to solve these problems. As a result, simmering tensions boil over into outright conflict. As the city streets become a battlefield between the organizations, the faction leaders each demand the characters' loyalty. Now, the characters must decide which factions are their allies, and which are their enemies. Eventually, the unraveling situation may require the characters to act directly against one or more of the factions, who respond with counterstrikes of their own. In turn, the characters may launch major assaults against enemy factions to destroy their {@book strongholds|DD|7}, defeat their leaders, and drive them out of Drakkenheim. As the conflict reaches its zenith, the surviving factions set their master plans into motion, requiring an expedition into {@book Castle Drakken|DD|8}.

The two spent vast sums commissioning the clergy of the {@book Sacred Flame|DD|2|Knights of the Silver Order} and the mages of the {@book Amethyst Academy|DD|2|The Amethyst Academy} to use divination magic to discern what happened, but to no avail. They nearly bankrupted themselves by launching multiple large-scale military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of which failed. Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further efforts were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown and relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim, arguing there was no conclusive evidence that confirmed their brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided over the issue, and a civil war ensued that raged for nearly a decade. As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal. Cecilia von Kessel herself died unexpectedly only a few days later, leaving behind no heirs of her own. Lacking a clear successor, the Civil War ended with a whimper.",
