The Inscrutable Tower library stands unguarded, filled with spellbooks containing secret arcana. My personal quest is to learn these spells.",

Perhaps then I can develop a way to reverse the contamination.",

Through these devoted acts I will understand my place in the divine order.",

Now, the characters must decide which factions are their allies, and which are their enemies.

As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal.

										"{@b Faction Aspirant.} Advancement in a {@book faction|DD|2} requires a full commitment from the character, exclusive of any other faction. Achieving this quest happens when a faction's leader regards the character as a capable and trusted confidant, and appoints them as their right-hand lieutenant. The most challenging aspect of this quest are the conflicts of interest it may cause with the other player characters, but embrace this conflict as a sticking point between the characters!",
										"{@b A Score to Settle.} This is a very difficult personal quest, but a straightforward one. The {@book faction leaders|DD|2} are all well-protected and formidable in their own right, though {@creature Lord Commander Elias Drexel|DD|Elias Drexel} and {@book Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal|DD|Theodore Marshal} are significantly easier to encounter in person. Characters targeting the {@creature Queen of Thieves|DD} or {@creature Eldrick Runeweaver|DD} are in for a vexing challenge!",
										"{@b Arcane Secrets.} These spells can be learned from {@book Oscar Yoren|DD|5|Reed Manor}, the {@book Pale Man|DD|5|Kleinberg Estate}, {@book Ryan Greymere|DD|5|Rose Theatre} and {@item spellbook|PHB|spellbooks} contained within the {@book Inscrutable Tower|DD|7|Inscrutable Tower}; the character must seek knowledge from each. Collecting these spells raises the ire of the {@book Amethyst Academy|DD|2|The Amethyst Academy}, who wish to keep knowledge of this magic secret. Characters can complete this quest by researching the {@i {@spell contaminated power|DD}} spell.",
										"{@b The Blighted Landscape.} After visiting each location, the character can research the {@i {@item aqua expurgo potion|DD}}, {@i {@spell neutralizing field|DD}}, and {@i {@spell contamination immunity|DD}} spells respectively, even if they haven't met the other prerequisites to research these spells.",
										"{@b A Family Matter.} Captive or convert, the relative is found at a {@book faction stronghold|DD|7}. They could even be one of the faction lieutenants! It is difficult to convince them to leave; they have to see the faction do something horrible with their own eyes.",
										"{@b Overwhelming Debt.} {@book Rival adventurers|DD|1|Rival Adventurers}, a {@book Queen's Men|DD|2|Queen's Men} strike team, or an assassin might be pursuing a bounty on the character. You may want to have the {@creature Queen of Thieves|DD} or the {@book Amethyst Academy|DD|2|The Amethyst Academy} “acquire” the character's debt and use that as leverage over them!",
										"{@b A Lost Heirloom.} Any rare magic item is an appropriate heirloom, and you can choose any location in the city where the item is lost, although {@book Reed Manor|DD|5|Reed Manor}, the {@book Kleinberg Estate|DD|5|Kleinberg Estate}, and {@book Slaughterstone Square|DD|6|Slaughterstone Square} are good possibilities. If you'd really like to create complications, this item could be stolen by the {@creature Queen of Thieves} of or a {@book rival adventurer|DD|1|Rival Adventurers}, or could even be one of the {@i {@book Seals of Drakkenheim|DD|1|Fall of House von Kessel|The Seals of Drakkenheim}}.",
										"{@b Personal Pilgrimage.} The ritual the character wishes to perform at each location need not be simple. Instead, it might be a time-consuming process that requires a rare offering and takes several hours to complete, or perhaps can only be performed at a certain time of day (either dawn or dusk). As such, the character will need the protection and support of their allies to stay safe during the rite.",
										"{@b Monster Slayer.} Suitable foes might include the {@creature Rat Prince|DD}, the {@creature Crimson Countess|DD}, the {@book Duchess|DD|6|Interactions}, the {@creature Lord of the Feast|DD}, the {@book Prince of Carnage|DD|8|Castle Grounds}, a {@book grotesque gargant|DD|10|Monster Modifications}, or a {@book crater wurm|DD|10|Monster Modifications}."

Using this information, it's up to you to determine how the factions might help or hinder the player characters during their adventures in Drakkenheim.",
												"Rather than uniting the factions as one against a common foe, the player characters must navigate a fractious web of intrigue, negotiation, sabotage, and violent conflict if they wish to uncover the greatest treasures and secrets in Drakkenheim. Their relationships with each faction will naturally develop as a consequence of the character's choices, but it's ultimately up to them to decide who they want to join and who they will oppose. Thus, each individual faction might become a supportive patron, fierce competitor, close ally, bitter enemy, or anything in between.",
												"Exploring the most dangerous locations in Drakkenheim is extraordinarily difficult without gaining the support (or inciting the ire) of one or more factions. Correspondingly, the factions need the player characters' help to accomplish their own goals in the city, and offer rewards to their allies and assistance with the characters' personal quests. Conversely, factions that become antagonistic create dynamic problems and new complications throughout the campaign when they use their resources against the characters. Either way, the factions are best played in a reactive manner. Their leaders make firm demands when characters try to negotiate, orchestrate counterstrikes when characters foil their plans, and conduct sabotage when characters oppose their goals.",
												"Eventually, these interactions may blossom into a full-scale hostility between the factions. Once this occurs, aim to keep each faction in play as long as possible. Don't be afraid of letting the players get in over their heads if they make enemies with more than one faction, either. Your players will find surprising ways to foil the factions, and develop cunning plans when they collaborate with them. Embrace their creativity by responding with new challenges, and rewarding players when they succeed by having their allies recognize their accomplishments. The factions are equipped with the tools to help you escalate tension and raise the stakes of the conflict in interesting ways.",

										"Despite their conflicts, the faction leaders know they can't achieve their goals on their own. Not only do they seek the aid of the player characters, many factions see the benefits to collaborating with each other. Diplomatic characters could negotiate an alliance, truce, or ceasefire between two (or more) factions. Convincing any two factions to set aside their differences and work together should be difficult, but achievable. In order to broker such a deal, characters will need to demonstrate how the alliance will help both factions achieve their objectives, but also make an appeal to the roleplaying traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws of the factions and their leaders. These tense negotiations can make for some of the most memorable moments in the campaign, so potential alliances are best arranged in dramatic locations such as the faction strongholds and the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio.",
										"The factions have been designed such that a long-term alliance between any two factions is achievable, and a short-term truce involving three is difficult but entirely possible. Countless situations in your campaign may emerge that could cause the factions to re-evaluate their priorities, and clever and convincing players might present compelling arguments. Bear in mind of course, that the factions are composed of people: and people don't always act in logical ways. These alliances are always unstable, however, as each faction presses to have their own goals prioritized. Unless the player characters make an ongoing effort to keep a coalition together, any alliance between factions will inevitably collapse.",
										"Factions such as the Amethyst Academy and the Queen's Men may even use alliances as a convenient opportunity to manipulate the player characters and the other factions, and possibly even make a dramatic reversal at a critical moment. Especially cunning characters might help the factions weave such deceptions and plots, resulting in brutal betrayal against an unsuspecting ally which allows the faction to seize full control of Drakkenheim for themselves.",
										"Since the threat of betrayal is so real, player characters who build a coalition between multiple factions may compromise the trust they earn with an individual faction. They won't receive the greatest boons the faction can offer, and faction agents don't trust characters with sensitive information. Faction leaders are wary of double-agents, and would much rather see the player characters make a commitment to them. As a result, the player characters should constantly be called upon to demonstrate their loyalty."

										"Unfortunately for the player characters, discovering the full properties of delerium and facts regarding the meteor's origins will not unite the factions. Instead, these revelations will drive further wedges between the fractious groups since they deeply disagree on the best way to address the problem. Given that The Haze threatens to overtake the entire world, it may at first appear the Silver Order is completely correct that the crystals must be destroyed. Throughout the campaign however, the feasibility of accomplishing such a task should be consistently cast in doubt. You should strive to contrast this viewpoint against the rational yet questionable stance of the Amethyst Academy which insists arcane means may harness delerium to prevent further catastrophe, and the zealous and apocalyptic prophecies of the Followers of the Falling Fire. Whenever it seems like the players have made up their minds, rival factions should present a gnawing sense that some alternative might still be possible. You should avoid presenting any “correct” answer: It's up to the characters to piece it all together, draw their own conclusions, and decide how to act.",
										"As such, there is no fixed resolution to the faction conflict. By the end of the campaign, several factions could be routed from Drakkenheim entirely, their leaders slain and strongholds toppled. While a showdown in Castle Drakken is inevitable, who exactly is present for that battle and the outcomes that may arise are unforeseeable.
