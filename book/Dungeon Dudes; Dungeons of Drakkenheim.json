My personal quest is to see for myself what lies at the heart of the crater. I must overcome whatever I find there in order to stop these nightmares.",
												"Arcane Secrets. Forbidden lore lies in Drakkenheim. Several dark wizards living in the ruins have mastered terrible and powerful new magic. The Inscrutable Tower library stands unguarded, filled with spellbooks containing secret arcana. My personal quest is to learn these spells.",
												"Blighted Landscape. A blight on the natural order envelops Drakkenheim, but the contamination could spread beyond the city. My personal quest is to study the unnatural phenomena found within the most corrupt places in the city: Queen's Park Garden, the underground waterways, and the Crater's Edge. Perhaps then I can develop a way to reverse the contamination.",
												"Claim the Throne. Though my family has fallen on hard times, we were distantly related to the royal House von Kessel. I may have a claim to the throne of Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to search the cathedral, noble estates, and the castle for sufficient evidence to conclusively prove my inheritance. Then I will take the crown for myself.",
												"Faction Aspirant. I believe strongly in the ideals and goals of one of the five factions: either the Amethyst Academy, the Followers of the Falling Fire, the Hooded Lanterns, the Knights of the Silver Order, or the Queen's Men. My personal quest is to join the faction, aid their mission, climb the ranks, and rise to a high leadership position within their organization.",
												"Family Matter. One of my family members or close friends has become mixed up with one of the factions. Perhaps they have foolishly decided to join the organization. Alternatively,they've been taken prisoner by the faction due to some trespass or misunderstanding. Either way, my personal quest is to bring them back home.",
												"Find a Cure. I have a friend, family member, or loved one who was contaminated by delerium and turned into a monster. They have gone mad, and are lost somewhere in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to locate them, then discover a way to reverse their horrific transformation.",
												"Lost Heirloom. I used to live in Drakkenheim. My personal quest is to recover a lost heirloom from my old home, which was located somewhere in the Inner City. Perhaps the item is sentimental, valuable only to members of my family. Alternatively it may have magical properties, and I wish to use these powers to aid my own ambitions.",
												"Monster Slayer. I wish to leave behind a heroic legacy by defeating dread beasts. My personal quest is to slay three of the greatest monsters rumoured to dwell in Drakkenheim, and bring back their heads as trophies. Each must be a notable creature with a challenge rating greater than my own level when I defeat them. My allies can assist me, but I must strike the decisive blow myself!",
												"Overwhelming Debt. I owe a tremendous debt of 10,000 gold pieces, maybe more. My personal quest is to pay it back by making a fortune in Drakkenheim collecting delerium, plunder, and completing work-for-hire. Meanwhile, I must hide from bounty hunters my creditor send to kill me.",
												"Personal Pilgrimage. As an acolyte of the faith, my personal quest is to visit several holy places in the city and perform a sacred ritual before the remains of the martyrs interred within each: the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, Saint Selina's Monastery, and the Chapel in Castle Drakken. Through these devoted acts I will understand my place in the divine order.",
												"Score to Settle. I have come to Drakkenheim to kill one of the faction leaders: either Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver, Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal, Lord Commander Elias Drexel, Lucretia Mathias, or the Queen of Thieves. Perhaps I seek revenge for a past wrong. Alternatively, I may covet their position and wish to replace them. Either way, my personal quest is to slay them."

If you've watched the original series and notice an inconsistency between this book and the show (there are many), the version in this book takes precedence. On the flipside, you should feel empowered to alter, change, and expand the material here, especially if doing so builds stronger connections or better stories for you and your players.",

								"The characters arrive in Drakkenheim to pursue their personal quests or a few freelance missions from friendly contacts in Emberwood Village. They face ravenous ratlings, malfeasant wizards, and rival adventurers in the Outer City Ruins. During their first forays into the city, the characters witness the strange magic of delerium and contend with the mysterious Haze. The threat of contamination makes survival in Drakkenheim difficult and dangerous. The characters may seek assistance and resources from the five factions to accomplish their goals and find a way deeper into the city.",
								"As the characters learn more about the factions' differing ideologies, the various faction leaders take notice of their progress. Once the characters successfully traverse the City Walls and begin exploring the Inner City Ruins, each leader approaches the characters for help with their objectives. They appeal to the characters' Ideals and Bonds, offer resources and support, and promise crucial assistance with the characters' personal quests.",
								"However, as the characters collaborate with the factions to advance their mutual goals, they become increasingly entangled in the political machinations between the competing groups. Each organization has a different vision for the future of Drakkenheim, and the tenuous peace won't last much longer. Nevertheless, with the support of one or more of these groups, the characters can explore dangerous Inner City locations such as the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, the Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy, or perhaps even mount an expedition into the crater. Characters may unearth stunning revelations from Drakkenheim's past and recover powerful artifact which threaten the balance of power between the factions. They might even discover how the Haze threatens to engulf the world itself.",
								"The factions are deeply divided over what must be done to solve these problems. As a result, simmering tensions boil over into outright conflict. As the city streets become a battlefield between the organizations, the faction leaders each demand the characters' loyalty. Now, the characters must decide which factions are their allies, and which are their enemies. Eventually, the unraveling situation may require the characters to act directly against one or more of the factions, who respond with counterstrikes of their own. In turn, the characters may launch major assaults against enemy factions to destroy their strongholds, defeat their leaders, and drive them out of Drakkenheim. As the conflict reaches its zenith, the surviving factions set their master plans into motion, requiring an expedition into Castle Drakken. There, a final showdown will decide the fate of Drakkenheim."
